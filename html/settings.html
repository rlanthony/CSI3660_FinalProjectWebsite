      <!-- about the script -->
      <h2 class="settings-subheader">Scripts Wrote</h2>
      <div class="script-container">
        <p class="settings-info">
          We wrote two scripts that allows general users to add movies/series to
          their Plex Library without having direct access to the
          /opt/plexmedia/movies and /opt/plexmedia/series directories. This is
          done as a security measure to prevent them from deleting other users
          media they have uploaded. It takes the file as an argument that is
          passed to the script and will add it to the corresponding directory,
          depending on whether it is a movie or a series. It also does a series
          of validation checks on the user input to make sure only one argument
          is provided and that the file exists. If the series/movie is
          successfully uploaded, the /var/log/memory-log file is updated to show
          the system's current memory.

          <br />
          <br />

          These scripts are in /home/plexusers/add_movie and
          /home/plexuser/add_series with the corresponding scripts for the type
          of media in each folder.

      <!-- what data is being logged -->
      <h2 class="settings-subheader">Data Being Logged</h2>
      <div class="logging-container">
        <div class="logging-text">
          <h3>System Features</h3>
          <p class="settings-info">
            The system's memory using the command $ df -h is logged every time a
            user successfully uploads a movie or series. This is built in to the
            add_movie.sh and add_series.sh scripts. It is written to the
            memory-log file in /var/log/.

            <br />
            <br />
            The other system feature being logged is all the IP addresses that
            have visited the website weekly. We implemented this by writing a
            script that creates a heading that shows the timeframe of the log
            and copies the data from /var/log/nginx/access.log into a new file
            in /var/log/ip_log_TIMESTAMP.
          </p>
          <h3>Process</h3>
          <p class="settings-info">
            The process being logged is the status of the completion of our
            daily backup of the movie and series files in /opt/plexmedia/movies
            and /opt/plexmedia/series. This data is being logged in the syslog
            file.

          <h3>What is being backed up</h3>
          <p class="settings-info">
            The following information is being backed up by the script:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="settings-info-bullet">
              Movies in /opt/plexmedia/movies
            </li>
            <li class="settings-info-bullet">
              Series in /opt/plexmedia/series
            </li>
          </ul>

          <!-- the how and why -->
          <h3>How it is being backed up and why</h3>
          <p class="settings-info">
            Archived and compressed into a tar.gz file Archiving is less easily
            corrupted Compressed since the files can become very large Scheduled
            by placing the script in /etc/cron.daily People are streaming at all
            times of the day The movie and series files are being backed up
            using a tar.gz file. These files archive all the media and then
            compresses them. This was done to minimize the amount of space the
            backups take on the system because the media files are extremely
            large, so solely archiving them would require a lot of storage. We
            also did not just want to compress them in the event that something
            happens to the file that causes it to be corrupted and then are the
            files are no longer feasible.
          </p>

          <!-- the where -->
          <h3>Where the backup is being stored</h3>
          <p class="settings-info">
            Each backup is stored in the /usr/localCSI3660ProjectBackups
            directory.
            <br />
            <br />
            The backup script itself is stored in /etc/cron.daily so that the
            media is backed up daily on the systems default time schedule. This
            was chosen since people are streaming at all times of the day, so
            there is not a best period to perform these backups.
